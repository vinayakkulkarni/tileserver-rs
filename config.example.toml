# Tile sources - PMTiles and MBTiles files
# You can add multiple sources, each with a unique ID

# Example: Local PMTiles file
# [[sources]]
# id = "osm"
# type = "pmtiles"
# path = "/data/osm.pmtiles"
# name = "OpenStreetMap"
# attribution = "<a href=\"https://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright\">© OpenStreetMap</a>"

# Example: Remote PMTiles file (requires http feature)
# [[sources]]
# id = "protomaps"
# type = "pmtiles"
# path = "https://example.com/tiles.pmtiles"
# name = "Protomaps Tiles"

# Example: Local MBTiles file
# [[sources]]
# id = "terrain"
# type = "mbtiles"
# path = "/data/terrain.mbtiles"
# name = "Terrain RGB"

# Map styles
# [[styles]]
# id = "osm-bright"
# path = "/data/styles/osm-bright/style.json"
# name = "OSM Bright"
